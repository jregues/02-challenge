# Week One Challenge: HTML, CSS, and Git

This site was created by me for our first homework challenge during the UNCC FullStack coding bootcamp. It is a mock assignment of an on-the-job ticket, where my task was to replace non-accessible HTML tags with semantic tags to improve the site's accessibility. The project was created in accordance to the following User Story and Acceptance Criteria.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
